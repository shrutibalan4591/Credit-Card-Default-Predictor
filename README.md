*****************************

## Motivation

With the growing number of credit card users, banks have been facing an escalating credit card default rate. This increase in defaults causes losses to the 
financial institutions along with the card holders. As such data analytics can provide solutions to tackle the current phenomenon and management of credit 
defaults. This project discusses the implementation of an model which predicts if a given credit card
holder has a probability of defaulting in the following month, using their demographic data and
behavioral data from the past 6 months.
**********************************

## Dataset Information
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card holders
from Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
